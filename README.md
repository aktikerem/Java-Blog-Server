# Java-Blog-Server
extremly ligth weight, non dependent, irc like aesthetic blog server.

# Quick Start
###### JBL which is short for Java Blog Server is how i will be calling it trough the Documentation and this Quick Start part

i originaly writed this repo to run on lowend cloud servers like the standart 512mb mem droplet using debian 10, so you should be able to just compile it with jdk 11 and run it on any linux machine.

###### yes it doesnt rely on any 3rd party libs so u dont need to strugle with gradle or sth

in server.java on the top of the file i leaved some config variables so you can use it to quickly adjust the server

###### if you cant accses the site after compiling and running the server.java file you may need to change the file paths since they are not relative but abslute

Here is a running version of the repo
